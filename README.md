👋 Hi, I’m Deepa
Technical Project Manager | Program Manager | Software Implementation Specialist

Bridging business, technology & global teams to deliver high-impact solutions.

🚀 About Me

I’m a Technical Project Manager / Program Manager with 10+ years of experience in software implementation, digital transformation, and cross-functional program delivery.

I bring a unique blend of:
  
  💼 Project & Program Management (PMP-certified)
  
  🧩 Product & Process Thinking
  
  🛠️ Technical understanding from my IT & engineering background
  
  🌍 Experience collaborating with global teams across time zones
  
  🤝 Stakeholder and client management expertise

I love connecting the dots between business needs and technical execution — helping teams build clear plans, reduce ambiguity, and deliver results.

🧠 What I’m Learning & Building

I’m using GitHub to expand and showcase my technical skillset, especially around:

  API integrations & automation
  
  LLMs & Generative AI
  
  Cloud & system architecture basics
  
  Data workflows
  
  Technical documentation & developer-friendly communication
  
  Lightweight prototypes & technical experimentation

This space is where I document what I’m learning — one small, meaningful project at a time.

My focus isn’t on being a full-time engineer — it’s on being a technical problem solver, a bridge between teams, and someone who can understand how systems work end-to-end.
